# PRACC APP

## Requirements

To build/run the app, the following tools/packages are needed:

- node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- expo cli (https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/get-started/installation/)
- git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- IDE: Intellij or Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) or whatever you prefer

For testing and debugging purpose:
android studio (https://developer.android.com/studio)
xcode (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

If you want to test your changes on a "real" device, please visit the app/play store of your device and download
the expo application.

## Setup

Get the project ready for development and testing:

Step 1: Create a directory on your local machine
Step 2: Open the cmd shell, move into the newly created dir and execute `git clone 'web url of the repo'`  
Step 3: Now use `npm install` to install all node module dependencies
Step 4: Start implementing new features, bugfixing etc.
Step 5: Execute the command `npm run start:prod` to test your changes against the production backend.

At this point you can start `testing the application`. Either you can start the android/ ios simulator e.g.
via android studio code and test your changes in the simulator or you can use your real mobile device
via the expo application.
